However, often DPOA overrides if they claim patient changed mind. *USMLE rule*: Living Will/Advance Directive usually guides if specific; if vague, DPOA decides. If conflict, DPOA is the legal agent. Check jurisdiction. In exams, usually **DPOA** or **Living Will** depending on wording. *Correction*: If patient is incapacitated, DPOA speaks. If no DPOA, look at Living Will. If DPOA acts against known wishes (Living Will), it's complex. Usually DPOA is the surrogate).
